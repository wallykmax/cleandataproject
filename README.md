# Basic description of this repository

## Obtaining the data

This repository contains script, instructions and information required to 
process the original data. To save storing space and avoid duplication the 
original data is not part of the repository, but can be obtained from the 
online.

The data can be obtained from

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should unzip the file in the same folder containing the "run_analysis.R"
script. The unzipped file will be called "UCI HAR Dataset".

A description of the original data set can be found in the "UCI HAR Dataset"
 folder.

## Processing the data

To process the data simply run the "run_analysis.R" script in R.

The "run_analysis.R" script will create a combined data set that will be saved 
in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset Merged", and a summarized data set saved as
"data_summary.txt"

## More information about the data processing

The file "CodeBook.md" describes the data set generated by "run_analysis.R".

More details on the data processing can be found as comments in the 
"run_analysis.R" script.
